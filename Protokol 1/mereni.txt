II. Questions
F.	What are the essential elements of a stimulus-response pathway? List them in their correct sequence.






G.	Explain the difference between a voluntary reaction to a stimulus and a reflex response to a stimulus.






H.	Reaction time using a dominant, voluntary motor pathway is usually shorter than when using an equivalent nondominant pathway. Explain.






I.	Reaction times associated with repetitive fixed interval stimuli in a given stimulus-response situation usually decrease over a short time period to some minimal value and then remain stable. Explain.
